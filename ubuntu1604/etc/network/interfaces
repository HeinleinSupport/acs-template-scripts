# see /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/movedhcpdefaultroute
# see /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
#
# with this hack, two dhcp offerings w/ two default routes are
# usable via iproute2
#
# Usage:
#
# a) eth0 as single managed (isolated or shared w/ dhcp) network
#
# b) eth0 as management network (isolated or shared w/ dhcp) PLUS
#    eth1 as isolated or shared w/ dhcp OR quick cloud w/o services
#

#
# first network
#
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
	pre-up  /sbin/ethtool -K eth0 tx off > /dev/null 2>&1 || /bin/true 

#
# second network (optional) / example w/ isolated or shared w/ dhcp
# due to asynchronous interface initialization, sleep for 3 secs on dhcp
#
#auto eth1
#iface eth1 inet dhcp
#	pre-up  /bin/sleep 3 > /dev/null 2>&1 || /bin/true 

#
# second network (optional) / example w/ quick cloud no services
#
#auto eth1
#iface eth1 inet static

#	netmask
